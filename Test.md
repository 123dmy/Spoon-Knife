To create a capital expenditure (CAPEX) model for a software development project with an initial cost of $7,506,279, an annual maintenance cost of $870,017, and a depreciation rate of 10%, we will calculate the depreciation expense each year and factor in the maintenance cost to determine the net cash flows over time. Let's assume a 5-year period for this model.

Here's how we can break down the CAPEX model:

1. **Initial Investment (Year 0):** $7,506,279
2. **Annual Maintenance Cost:** $870,017
3. **Depreciation:** Calculate annual depreciation as 10% of the initial investment ($7,506,279 * 10% = $750,628 per year).

Now, let's create a table to represent the CAPEX model:

| Year | Cash Flow In | Cash Flow Out | Depreciation | Maintenance Cost | Net Cash Flow |
|------|--------------|---------------|--------------|------------------|---------------|
| 0    | -$7,506,279  |               |              |                  | -$7,506,279   |

| 2    |              |               | -$750,628    | -$870,017        | -$1,620,645   |

In this model:
- Year 0 represents the initial investment of -$7,506,279.
- Years 1-5 show the annual depreciation expense, maintenance costs, and resulting net cash flows.

Depreciation is calculated as 10% of the initial investment, resulting in -$750,628 per year.

The maintenance cost of $870,017 is subtracted each year from the cash flows, resulting in a net cash flow for each year.

This model provides an overview of the cash flows associated with the software development project over its useful life, considering both depreciation and maintenance costs. Adjustments can be made to the model based on specific project requirements, financing considerations, and industry standards.
