Installation
============

Package Installation
--------------------

You can install from a local or remote archive using ``pip``::

  pip install https://github.com/datacenter/pydme/archive/master.zip

You can also install from a local directory using ``pip``::

  pip install -e .


DME Meta Data
---------------

PyDME requires metadata about DME model. PyDME gets the software
version of the device during the initialization.

Once it get the version of the device, it looks for the 
dme-<version>-meta.json file in the current directory for getting
the entire meta data and if it is not found, it will go the web site
and gets it and stores it in the current directory.

If PyDME is unable to get either of these files, it will exit
the program.

Note: If the PyDME is cloned from the github and application code
is written using that, then PYDME_HOME environmental variable must be
set to the path of pydme clone directory. This is used to find the 
json files if they are not found in the current directory.
