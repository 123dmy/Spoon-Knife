  ...Thankyou, @octocat! For setting this up.
  I am trying to understand the difference between forking to my personal github directory
  and simply git cloning  https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife  to a directory on my computer.
  Is it common to fork to your personnal github and then clone that to your personnal computer?
  Does this create problems or advantages?
  I am trying to understand how best to work...and there are so many ways to use github it is confusing.
