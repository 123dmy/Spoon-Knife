  Forking is synonymous with branching in SVN, CVS, or TFS.
  Why the fork did they decide to call it a fork instead of a branch?  I guess it works ... taking a fork in the road - the road less traveled by.  That has made all the difference - ooh, I bet you can do a diff too!

  Wait!  The Commit Changes says "branch" ... oh, I am confused.  Are these two separate things?  Or is GIT just trying to "brand" itself?

  Who is Octocat?  Is he/she a 8 legged feline?
