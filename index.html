  ...Thankyou, @octocat! For setting this up.
  I am trying to understand the difference between forking to my personal github directory
  and simply git cloning  https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife  to a directory on my computer.
  Is it common to fork to your personnal github and then clone that to your personnal computer?
  Does this create problems or advantages?
  I am trying to understand how best to work...and there are so many ways to use github it is confusing.
</p>

<p>Found a helpful note here:
Clone Your Fork
https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/index.html
Youâ€™ve successfully forked the Spoon-Knife repository, but so far, it only exists on GitHub. 
To be able to work on the project, you will need to clone it to your computer.</p>

<p>So it is common practice to "Fork a repository" to your personnal github repository, then to "Clone to your personnal computer"</p>
