<h1>Fork</h1>
<p>
This strange thing must have crept<br>
Right out of hell.<br>
It resembles a bird's foot<br>
Worn around the cannibal's neck.<br>
As you hold it in your hand,<br>
As you stab with it into a piece of meat,<br>
It is possible to imagine the rest of the bird:<br>
Its head which like your fist<br>
Is large, bald, beakless and blind.<br>
