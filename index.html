<!-- Feel free to change this text here -->
<p>
  This is an edit of the original text!
  But it is a way better one ... Right? I mean it is written down that this text is better than
  the old one. And .. Did you realize that you cannot even check wether this text is really
  better than the old one? Because it is not there any more (Hehehehe).
