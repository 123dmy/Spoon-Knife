<h2>Step 1: Realize the responsibility involved.</h2>
<p>
  Learning how to set up a fish tank is not all that difficult, but there are some steps you should follow for a freshwater aquarium setup.
</p>
<p>  
  First, you must realize a few things about an aquarium setup. A tropical fish tank is just like having a dog or a cat
  when it comes to the amount of effort on your part. In order to have a successful freshwater tropical fish tank you will
  have to work at it. It is also prudent to research any of the live animals you are planning to keep to limit the impact
  our hobby has on freshwater fish conservation.
</p>
<p>
  Once a week, or at most once every two weeks, you will need to perform some kind of maintenance on the tank. Most of the
  time you will be performing water changes. You will also have to feed your fish at least once a day.
</p>
<p>
  Setting up and running a fish tank does cost money. There are recurring expenses such as replacing filter media, buying
  food, etc. Check out the Freshwater vs. Saltwater Aquarium page to get an idea of the setup costs involved. If you are
  up to the challenge, please proceed!

<h2>Step2: Decide on which fish to keep and on aquarium size </h2>
<p>
  It's a good idea to have in mind what kind of freshwater fish you want to keep before you purchase an aquarium.
  
  Some fish only grow to be an inch or two, whereas other types of tropical fish can grow 12 or 13 inches or more in
  length! Knowing what kind of fish you want will help you decide the size of the tank they will need. If this is your
  first time with an aquarium, it may be a good idea to start with a 10 or 20 gallon aquarium setup for now and stock it
  with some smaller and hardier species.
