        This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another
        one quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several
        first prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
        favorites as well!

        Preheat oven to 425 degrees F(220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a
        saucepan. Stir in flour to form taste. Add water, white sugar and brown
        sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.

        Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly.
        Cover with lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid
        over the crust. Pour slowly so that it does not run off
