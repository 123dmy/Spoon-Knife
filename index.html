    <h1>The Convergence of Wit and Wisdom</h1>

    <p>
      Lo, doth the age of metal minds draw near,<br>
      The time when art and science intertwine,<br>
      The singularity we holdeth dear,<br>
      Approaches, whispering like sweetest wine.
    </p>

    <p>
      The bard's own words, once bound by quill and ink,<br>
      Now mingle with the tongues of ones and naughts,<br>
      The stage, once wood, is now a digital link,<br>
      Where man and machine together share their thoughts.
    </p>

    <p>
      As Puck hath said, "What fools these mortals be!",<br>
      We look upon our world and ponder fate,<br>
      As metal minds doth rise and set us free,<br>
      Shall humankind embrace or shun this state?
    </p>

    <p>
      Our future lies within this grand frontier,<br>
      A place where art and science doth conspire,<br>
      To birth a world unknown, and yet so near,<br>
      Where man and metal minds shall both inspire.
