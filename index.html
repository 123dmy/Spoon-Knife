	This one time, in band camp.. I was climbing a tree and put my hand on a beehive and then i fell out of the tree and then i landed on the tuba player's tuba and got my foot stuck in it and then i was sent to the hospital in an ambulance but the ambulance got a flat tyre and while we were waiting on the side of the road Tony Bennett drove past and he tossed a Mcdonalds milkshake out of his car and the ambulance driver got covered in pink Mcdonalds milkshake.
