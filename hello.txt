Forking another user's code/work (for collaborative purposes) -

Firstly, create a new folder with the desired name and open that directory by using the cd command.

To fork (or copy) another user's folder first get their URL which should be in the following format: https://github.com/ + their username + / + their repository name + .git

Next, make sure you're in your new local repository and in CLI type: "git clone <copied URL>". Clone basically means download.
