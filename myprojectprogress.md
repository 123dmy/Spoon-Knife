At the conclusion of our last lab, Lab 2, my group decided to follow through with a Google Chrome extension.

Google Chrome itself is a distribution of the open source project Google Chromium, which makes development more versatile.
There is a large community revolving around the development of such extensions.

My group (Table 5) consists of Alvin Leung, Christopher Ngai, Aman Zargarpur, and Helen Lane.

This file should be pushed on the Spoon-Knife fork!

Sumit Munshi
