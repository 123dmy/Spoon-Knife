# Minas Morgul Door Opener
by Wyatt Sorerson

Requirements: Windows CLI

Arguments: 
	1) divisor1: prints FIZZ if dividend is divisable by divisor1
	2) divisor2: prints BUZZ if dividend is divisable by divisor2
	3) maximum dividend: iterates from 1 to maximum dividend

Explanation:
This program generates the passwords needed (similar to "speak 'FIZZBUZZ' and enter") to open a door in Minas Morgul. The door opens to a passage way to the Black Gate.  It is must be magical due to the fact that the Black Gates are over 200 km away.

Usage example: 

input: 
$ ./MinasMorgulDoorOpener.exe 3 2 12

output:
