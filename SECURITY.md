## Reporting a Vulnerability
I'm communicating as much as I can 
Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.
it's been frustrating and difficult recovering my email having them interrupt with the internet and life 
Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.
