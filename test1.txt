This is just a test! I'm going to send octocat a pull request now on GitHub with this new, and incredibly fascinating piece of text! 

int arrSize = 0;
cin >> arrSize;

int* pInt = new int[arrSize];

for(int i = 0; i < arrSize; i++)
	{
	    pInt[i] = rand() % 100;
	    cout << pInt[i] << endl;
	} 

<p>Bla bla bla</p>

(format t "~a~%" "Hello World! Goodbye, now.")

System.out.println("Hello Again! You thought I left, didn't you?");
