Well hello there!
=================

This repository is intended to serve as an example for *forking* a repository on GitHub.

Creating a *fork* involves producing a personal copy of someone else's project. Forks serve as a kind of connection between the original repository and your personal copy. You can submit *Pull Requests* to contribute to improving other people's projects by proposing your changes to the original project. Forking lies at the heart of social coding on GitHub.

After forking this repository, you can make changes to the project and submit [a Pull Request](https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife/pulls) for practice.

For more information on how to fork a repository, [check out our guide, "Forking Projects"](http://guides.github.com/overviews/forking/). Thanks! :sparkling_heart:
