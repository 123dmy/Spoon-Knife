# Considerations about the copyright, usage rights and other licensing context
* This is not a license, nor a copyright notice, neither a legal document,
  just a "warning notice" for possible license concerns.
* If you need a license, first try to search for one, that can be applicable to you
  * possible locations can be ./LICENSE or ./LICENSE.txt file, ./LICENSE or ./license folder and it's content,
  ./copyright-notice.txt or ./copyright-notice.md file or other sensible places.

## Loose term definitions to reduce scope
* 'direct parent container': the folder, project, repository, database item, filesystem element
  or other entity that directly contains this warning notice (according to the user percived system/folder hierarchy)
  is the probable candidate for this concept, that I will refer to as 'direct parent container'
* 'related files and data': any data that is located inside the direct parent container - including subfolders, subprojects,
  files, source code, datasets, documents, text, visual and audio content

## If there is no valid and applicable license present partially or entirely ('missing license'), consider the following
* In case of 'missing license', consider the "No License", "no permission" and "all rights are reserved" possibilities.
* In some cases default rights, terms of service, fair use, public domain use or other conditions might apply,
  * but I can't give you here any legal advice whatsoever on when and how these things might or might not apply to your specific case.
* If you are in a serious doubt, you might consider seeking for a professional help
  from a lawyer or organization specialized in Intellectual Property Law
* For projects and repositories hosted on GitHub, it can be helpful to visit the
  [GitHub Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service)
* For other 'related files and data' you can try to search for terms or conditions of the service provider or entity
  that hosts or stores the 'direct parent container'

## Possible reasons for missing license might include, but not limited to:
* The authoring entities ('authors'):
  * has no intention to give you a license, and they want to "reserve all rights" (that they can).
  * forgot to provide a license or don't know how to do it properly.
  * have not yet decided on how to license their work.
  * want to preserve the most possible rights until they choose to license it.
* The 'authors' might be in a belief
  * that the some or all of the 'related files and data' are outside of the scope of copyright
    * for example: not a unique work or already in the public domain elsewhere etc.
  * the work is not ready to be released to the general public
    * possibly not even as beta version or "work in progress"
  * the work is personal or private in nature, and it should not be used outside this context
  * the work is not worth the struggle to license it
  * the work contains elements that makes licensing hard or not possible for them

Either way, consider not making a hasty assumption, better to confirm the reasons with the 'authors', if that is possible

## Important notices by the 'authors'
These notices are not considered as part of any license agreement for the 'related files and data', but
they are important warnings and guidelines provided by the 'authors'.

Failure to comply with these notices are not always directly enforcable by the law, but
they can have other implications, like technical issues, reduced credibility in a given community etc.

### Documentation
* Refer to the ./README.md file as well for further information
  before operating the software or using any 'related files and data'.
* Do not use the 'related files and data', if you are not confident
  in your usage rights, or in possible technical issues, that can araise.

### **NO WARRANTY**
* If you are in doubt, you might consider not using any of the 'related files and data'!
* Unless otherwise stated in a valid and applicable license or other legal document, no warranty shall apply.
* Consider the relevant sections in the GPLv3 as a general rule of thumb
  * Further reading: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.md
