Greetings Group B participants,

Hello everyone!

We are excited to let you know that you have been matched for a meeting.

Here's your conversation starter:
What is your guilty pleasure?

And here's a joke to lighten the mood:

Lastly, we thought you might enjoy doing this activity together:

Best regards,
The organizers
