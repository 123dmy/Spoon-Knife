Why are the only options commit directly to master or create a new branch AND start a pull request? What if I only want to update my own fork without starting a pull request? Is the 'master' my copy of the master I forked from or is it the master? How can I commit directly to the master when I am not the master? Why would I create a pull request for the master if I can commit directly?
