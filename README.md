### Well hullo there! Glad you could join us!

This repository is meant to provide an example for *forking* a repository on GitHub. Fork you, fork me.

Creating a *fork* is producing a personal copy of someone else's project. Forks act as a sort of bridge between the original repository and your personal copy. You can submit *Pull Requests* to help make other people's projects better by offering your changes up to the original project. Forking is at the core of social coding at GitHub. It should be called a push request, although if we are coming from the perspective of the owner of the repo in the naming, I guess pull request makes sense. Becuase they have to approve the code to pull into their main branch.

After forking this repository, you can make some changes to the project, and submit [a Pull Request](https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife/pulls) as practice. Yeah, I can.

For some more information on how to fork a repository, [check out our guide, "Forking Projects""](http://guides.github.com/overviews/forking/). Thanks! :sparkling_heart: :thinking::
