### Well hello there!

This repository is meant to provide an example for *forking* a repository on GitHub.

Creating a *fork* is producing a personal copy of someone else's project. Forks act as a sort of bridge between the original repository and your personal copy. You can submit *Pull Requests* to help make other people's projects better by offering your changes up to the original project. Forking is at the core of social coding at GitHub.

After forking this repository, you can make some changes to the project, and submit [a Pull Request](https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife/pulls) as practice.

For some more information on how to fork a repository, [check out our guide, "Forking Projects""](http://guides.github.com/overviews/forking/). Thanks! :sparkling_heart:

Steps:
Forked the repo "Spoon-Knife" by clicking the "fork" button on the top right of the "Spoon-Knife" GitHub repo page
Logged in to own GitHub account
Clicked the "Clone or Download" button on the top right of the repo in my own GitHub account
Copied the url to the clipboard
Went to a directory on my local system and ran the command "git clone <url>"
Made some changes to this very file (README.md)
Now need to:
-Stage and commit these changes: "git commit -am "changes to README.md"
-Push the new commit to the remote/ my GitHub repo: "git push origin master"
-Make a pull request by clicking on the button: "Compare and pull request" in the my GitHub repo
