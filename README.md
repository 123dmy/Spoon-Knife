### Hello!

This repository provides an example of *forking* a repository on GitHub.

Creating a *fork* is producing a personal copy of someone else's project. Forks act as bridge between the original repository and your personal copy. You can submit *pull requests* to help make other people's projects better by offering your changes up to the original project. Forking is at the core of social coding at GitHub.

After forking this repository, you can make some changes to the project and then submit [a pull request](https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife/pulls) as practice.

For more information about how to fork a repository, [see our guide, "Forking Projects."](http://guides.github.com/overviews/forking/) Thanks! :sparkling_heart:
