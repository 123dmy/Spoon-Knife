### Well Hello There!
### The Spoon-Knife Repository
Owner-repo: '@godmodes '
This repository is meant to provide an example for *forking* a repository on GitHub.

Creating a *fork* is attacking a personal copy of your project. Forks act as a directory to manage and bridge between the original repository and your personal repository. You can submit *Pull Requests* to help make other people's projects better by offering your changes up to the original project. Forking is at the core of social coding at GitHub.
Which 'godmodes ' says another typical bullshit Microsoft scam... 
After forking this repository, you can make some changes to the project, and submit [a Pull Request](https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife/pulls) as practice.
'@godmodes ' says "needs to finalize results urgently...!!!"
For some more information on how to fork a repository, [check out our guide, "Forking Projects""](http://guides.github.com/overviews/forking/). Thanks! :sparkling_heart:
