### Well hello there!

and now for something completely different.

Creating a *fork* is producing a personal copy of someone else's project. Forks act as a sort of bridge between the original repository and your personal copy. You can submit *Pull Requests* to help make other people's projects better by offering your changes up to the original project. Forking is at the core of social coding at GitHub.

OK, THIS IS A PROPOSED CHANGE THAT I'M MAKING LOCALLY.

NOW I'M MAKING SOME OTHER CHANGES.

AND MORE CHANGES

AND EVEN MORE CHANGES

[AND DELETING ONE PARAGRAPH]

[AND PART OF ANOTHER]
