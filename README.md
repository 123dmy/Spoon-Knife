### Well hello there!

This repository is a fork of Spoon-Knife, a repository meant to provide an example for *forking* a repository on GitHub.

Creating a *fork* is producing a personal copy of someone else's project. Forks act as a sort of bridge between the original repository and your personal copy. You can submit *Pull Requests* to help make other people's projects better by offering your changes up to the original project. Forking is at the core of social coding at GitHub.

After forking this repository, you can make some changes to the project, and submit [a Pull Request](https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife/pulls) as practice.

For some more information on how to fork a repository, [check out our guide, "Forking Projects""](http://guides.github.com/overviews/forking/). Thanks! :sparkling_heart:

#### Thank you, @octocat!

When I migrated from a private git server to my GitHub provided Student Developer Pack, I immediately started working on projects like my website, [EtherTyper/www](github.com/EtherTyper/www), and miscellaneous projects like DogeCoin powered Minecraft implementations.

However, I soon realized something was wrong. There were no childish examples like I was used to; @octocat gave that back to me!

A simple example of how forking, pushing, and pulling can be used in this compelling GUI was all it took to get me up and running!

I'm proud to honor the tradition of forking the Spoon-Knife like all my fellow GitHubbers.

So, for the joy and education Spoon-Knife brings daily, I say "Thank you!"
