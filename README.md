### HO HO HO yello there!

This repository is meant to provide an example for *forking* a repository on *GitHub*.

Creating a *fork* is producing a personal copy of someone _else's_ project. Forks act as a sort of bridge between the original repository and your personal copy. You can submit *Pull Requests* to help make other people's projects better by offering your changes up to the original project. Forking is at the core of social coding at GitHub.

After __forking__ this repository, you can make some changes to the project, and submit [a Pull Request](https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife/pulls) as practice.

For some more [info](http://connieqian.co) on how to fork a repository, [check out our guide, "Forking Projects""](http://guides.github.com/overviews/forking/). ~~Thanks!~~ :sparkling_heart:

```
function test() {
 console.log("notice the blank");
