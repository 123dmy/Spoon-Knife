### Well hello there!

This repository is meant to provide an example for *forking* a repository on GitHub.

Creating a *fork* is producing a personal copy of someone else's project. Forks act as a sort of bridge between the original repository and your personal copy. You can submit *Pull Requests* to help make other people's projects better by offering your changes up to the original project. Forking is at the core of social coding at GitHub.

After forking this repository, you can make some changes to the project, and submit [a Pull Request](https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife/pulls) as practice.

Well, as everyone knows that this repository i.e. *Spoon-Knife* should be the first repository from which a newbie should start learning about open source. But best advice to a newbie can only be given by a newbie who is also facing a lot of trouble nowadays in getting to know about open source. Hence, as a newbie like you ,I request you to first know about the terminology(if you don't know it) which will be going to use at github while you will be working. Here is the [link](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/) for it.

For some more information on how to fork a repository, [check out our guide, "Forking Projects""](http://guides.github.com/overviews/forking/). Thanks! :sparkling_heart:
