### Well hello there!

This repository is meant to provide an example for *forking* a repository on GitHub.

Creating a *fork* is producing a personal copy of someone else's project. Forks act as a sort of bridge between the original repository and your personal copy. You can submit *Pull Requests* to help make other people's projects better by offering your changes up to the original project. Forking is at the core of social coding at GitHub.

After forking this repository, you can make some changes to the project, and submit [a Pull Request](https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife/pulls) as practice.

For some more information on how to fork a repository, [check out our guide, "Forking Projects""](http://guides.github.com/overviews/forking/). Thanks! :sparkling_heart:

I do not understand this. I'm beginning to dislike
those 'oh it's easy, you just....' people.

I add this and commit it to my 'fork' (branch?) of
the octocat/spoon-knife repo?
	git commit -a -m "insert pertinent message here"
	
This updates the file both on my local machine and
the hubbriter/s-k repo on github. (I think).
	[Edit] Well it does after git push ... :-))

I then issue a pull request? to octocat??

If the cat accepts the request the octocat/s-k repo readme
gets updated so anyone forking after that would see these
lines in the readme.md file?

I think thats what would happen anyway. I really have
to read more documentation.
