First, I have tried to solve the bugs.

After successfully building the project, I have started work with given tasks. I don't know much more about SQLite database but after reading the requirements and details, I was able to manage to work with it.

For detailed understanding of requirement (Task-2), I need to go through the “YesWeCan” solution.

For me, uploading code to GitHub is only a bit of a difficult task for me as I don't have any experience with it, but I have searched on google for that.

I have spent approximately 2 hours on this whole task.
