### Well hello there!

This repository is an example providing a testbed for *forking* GitHub repositories.

*Forks* produce personal copies of someone else's project. Forks act as a bridge
between the original repository and your personal copy. You can submit *Pull Requests*
to make other people's projects better by offering your changes to the original project.
Forking is the core of social coding at GitHub.

After forking this repository, make some changes to the project, and submit
[a Pull Request](https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife/pulls) as practice.

For more information on forking repositories,
[check out our guide, "Forking Projects""](http://guides.github.com/overviews/forking/).

Thanks! :sparkling_heart:
