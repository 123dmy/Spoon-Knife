# Welcome to Spoon-Knife!

## Introduction

Hello and welcome to this repository! This space is designed to guide you through the process of forking a GitHub repository, an essential skill in the world of collaborative coding.

## What is Forking?

Forking a repository means creating your own personal copy of someone else's project. It serves as a bridge between the original repository and your personal copy, enabling you to make changes without affecting the original project directly. Forking lies at the heart of social coding on GitHub.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Forking the Repository

1. Navigate to the [Spoon-Knife repository](https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife).
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of the page.
3. Congratulations! You now have your own copy of Spoon-Knife in your GitHub account.

### Step 2: Making Changes

1. After forking, make changes to the project on your personal copy.
2. Explore, experiment, and customize to your heart's content!

### Step 3: Submitting a Pull Request

1. Once you've made changes, navigate to the "Pull Requests" tab in your forked repository.
2. Click the "New Pull Request" button.
3. Set the base repository to "Spoon-Knife" and the base branch to "main."
4. Compare changes and create the pull request!
5. Describe your changes, provide context, and submit your pull request.
