### Well hello there!

This repository is meant to provide an example for *forking* a repository on GitHub.

Creating a *fork* is producing a personal copy of someone else's project. Forks act as a sort of bridge between the original repository and your personal copy. You can submit *Pull Requests* to help make other people's projects better by offering your changes up to the original project. Forking is at the core of social coding at GitHub.

After forking this repository, you can make some changes to the project, and submit [a Pull Request](https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife/pulls) as practice.

For some more information on how to fork a repository, [check out our guide, "Forking Projects""](http://guides.github.com/overviews/forking/). Thanks! :sparkling_heart:

------------------

All that glitters is not gold
By the pricking of my thumbs, Something wicked this way comes. Open, locks, Whoever knocks!
Hell is empty and all the devils are here.
The lady doth protest too much, methinks.
These violent delights have violent ends...
Good night, good night! parting is such sweet sorrow, That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
Now is the winter of our discontent.
Brevity is the soul of wit.
Fair is foul, and foul is fair: Hover through the fog and filthy air.
If music be the food of love, play on.
