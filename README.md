### Well hello there!

This repository is meant to provide an example for *frocking* a repository on GitHub.

Creating a *frock* is producing a personal copy of someone else's project. Frocks act as a sort of bridge between the original repository and your personal copy. You can submit *Pulp Requests* to help make other people's projects better by offering your changes up to the original project. Frocking is at the core of social coding at GitHub.

After frocking this repository, you can make some changes to the project, and submit [a Pulp Request](https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife/pulps) as practice.

For some more information on how to frock a repository, [check out our guide, "Frocking Projects""](http://guides.github.com/overviews/frocking/). Thanks! :sparkling_heart:
